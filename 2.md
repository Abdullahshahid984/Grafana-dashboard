Thanks for checking this. I also tested the endpoint locally and can confirm it works fine from outside AKS. The issue only happens from within the AKS cluster, and the “no peer certificate available” error indicates that the TLS handshake is being blocked before the certificate is returned.

This behavior typically occurs when the storage account firewall or private endpoint configuration is not allowing traffic from the AKS subnet or outbound IPs. So it doesn’t appear to be an issue within the AKS path itself, but rather a networking restriction on the storage side.

It looks like we’ll need a firewall rule update or private endpoint configuration change to allow AKS to reach the blob endpoint. Since we don’t have permissions to create or modify the storage private endpoint, we will need the appropriate team to update this for us.

Validation and Permission Granting (Explanation)

When you click Validate, Azure checks whether the Managed Identity has the required permissions to perform the restore operation on the target AKS cluster and associated resources.

If the Managed Identity does not have the necessary roles, the Grant Permissions button will automatically become enabled.
Click Grant Permissions to allow Azure Backup to assign all required roles.
This is a one-time process and only needs to be completed the first time you perform a restore on this cluster or subscription.

After granting roles, run the Validate step again to confirm that all permissions are correctly applied.

There is a small update in the Terraform output related to the routing configuration.

We need to explicitly include the routing block because internet routing is not permitted in this environment. All traffic must use Microsoft routing, which is the expected and approved behavior.

The routing block reflects the existing configuration in Azure and does not introduce any actual changes. The attributes appear in the Terraform plan because the resource has been imported and Terraform is aligning its state with the current setup.

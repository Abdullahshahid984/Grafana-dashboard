A Storage Account for AKS Backup has already been successfully provisioned. The next step is to configure and deploy the AKS Backup Extension on the existing AKS cluster using Terraform.

This implementation must be done within the existing parent Terraform module — no child or separate module is required. The solution should involve creating the necessary Terraform configuration files directly in the parent module.

The AKS Backup Extension should be deployed without a User Assigned Managed Identity, 

The objective is to enable AKS Backup functionality by attaching the extension to the cluster while keeping the Terraform structure simple, aligned with the current module design, and compliant with best practices.

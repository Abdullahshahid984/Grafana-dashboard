Thanks for the clarification.

To confirm, the storage accounts were created manually as a temporary approach to unblock initial progress and validation. This was not intended to bypass organizational or team standards.

I fully understand and align with our standard process of using IaC, change requests, and approvals, and I’m happy to transition these resources accordingly or recreate them through IaC where required.

Also, just to clarify, this was done with awareness of the organization’s governance and is aligned with the understanding that ClickOps is acceptable for POC / DEV, while production changes will strictly follow the standard procedures.

Please let me know how you’d like to proceed (IaC implementation or CR creation), and I’ll take care of it.

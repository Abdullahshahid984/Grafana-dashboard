Good call. I have updated the module to make account_tier, account_replication_type, and access_tier configurable inputs, with defaults matching the current values (Standard / ZRS / Cool).

The defaults were selected based on Azure guidance and current usage patterns  Cool access tier aligns with backup/archive-style workloads where data is infrequently accessed, and ZRS provides improved resilience within a region compared to LRS while remaining cost-effective.

Exposing these as variables gives us flexibility for other workloads, regions, or access patterns while preserving the existing behavior.

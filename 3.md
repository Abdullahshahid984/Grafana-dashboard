The application team has a storage account in the UAT environment saseus2batchblob01, and they need to access this storage account from the SIT AKS pods as well. We have already submitted a firewall request, but we need your confirmation on the correct approach.

Should we proceed with the firewall request to allow cross-environment access, or should a separate storage account be created for each environment?

Thanks.

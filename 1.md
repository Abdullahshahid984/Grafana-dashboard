During the Istio upgrade, pods across the cluster were restarted as part of the rolling update process.

When pods restart:

Readiness probes temporarily fail

Replica counts fluctuate

Prometheus detects short-lived mismatches

BigPanda generates incidents

This behavior is expected during control plane upgrades.

Most pods recovered automatically within normal restart time.

One application exposed a pre-existing secret configuration issue, which is unrelated to Istio itself.

# How to Configure a Backup Instance for AKS (Full Detailed Steps)

A Backup Instance defines what to back up and how to back it up inside an AKS cluster.

It connects:

Backup Vault → AKS Cluster → Backup Policy → Protected Resources

# STEP 1 — Open Your Backup Vault

1. Go to the Azure Portal
2. Search for Backup Vault
3. Open the Backup Vault you created earlier (example: aks-backup-vault-prod)

# STEP 2 — Start Creating a Backup Instance

1. In the left menu, select Backup Instances
2. Click + Add
3. Azure will ask what you want to back up. Select:
   Backup Type → Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

# STEP 3 — Select Your AKS Cluster

1. A list of AKS clusters appears
2. Select the AKS cluster you want to protect
3. Click Continue

# STEP 4 — Choose Protection Scope

Decide which parts of the cluster will be backed up.

A. Protect Entire Cluster
Select: All namespaces

B. Protect Only Specific Namespaces
Select: Selected namespaces
Choose the namespaces you want (example: prod, api, payments)

C. Protect by Labels
Select: Label selector
Example label:
environment=production

D. Automatically Protect Future Namespaces
Toggle on: Automatically protect new namespaces

Click Next

# STEP 5 — Select Resources to Include in Backup

You will see a list of resource types. Enable whichever you need:

Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)
Secrets
ConfigMaps
Deployments / StatefulSets
CRDs
Cluster-scoped resources
Workload resources
Application resources only

Recommended for production:
PVCs
Secrets
ConfigMaps
Workloads

Click Next

# STEP 6 — Assign Backup Policy

Decide how often backups should run.

You can:

A. Choose an existing policy
or
B. Create a new policy

Example recommended policy:

Backup Frequency: Every 4 hours
Retention: 30 days
Backup Types:
Snapshot Backup
Vault Backup (recommended for offsite protection)

Click Next

# STEP 7 — Optional: Add Backup Hooks

Useful for databases or other stateful applications.

You can add:

Pre-backup hook (freeze database, pause writes)
Post-backup hook (unfreeze database, resume writes)

If not required, click Next

# STEP 8 — Review and Create Backup Instance

Azure shows a final summary:

Selected AKS cluster
Namespaces included
Resource types selected
Backup Policy assigned
Hook configuration
PVC inclusion

If everything is correct, click Create Backup Instance

# STEP 9 — Verify Backup Instance

After creation:

1. Go to Backup Instances inside the Backup Vault
2. Select your new instance
3. Confirm status shows:
   Configured
   Backup Policy Applied
   Next Scheduled Backup Time

This confirms that the instance is active.

# STEP 10 — Run First Manual Backup

1. Open the Backup Instance
2. Click Backup Now
3. Monitor the backup under:
   Backup Jobs (inside the Backup Vault)
   Backup Center (global Azure backup dashboard)

Your AKS Backup Instance is now fully configured and ready.

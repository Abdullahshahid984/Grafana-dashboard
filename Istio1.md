Hi,

I’m currently working on the Istio upgrade in the POC environment. While reviewing the cluster, I noticed that several Azure Istio CNI node pods are running in the aks-istio-system namespace.

Could you please confirm if this is expected as part of the current configuration? I would like to ensure everything is correct before proceeding with the upgrade from asm-1-26 to asm-1-27.

Thank you.
